# How do you solicit user text input when running JavaScript in the browser?
---
Use prompt() to display a dialog box.
```
let some_input = prompt();
let name = prompt("What is your name?");
```
If the user clicks `OK`, `prompt()` returns the input as a string. 
If the user clicks `Cancel`, `prompt()` returns `null`. 

# How do you display a dialog box to the user with an OK button to dismiss it? This is good for emssages that do not need any input from the user.

alert();
alert("Hello world");
