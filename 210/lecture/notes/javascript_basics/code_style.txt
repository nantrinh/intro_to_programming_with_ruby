# True or False: JavaScript has only one type of variable.
---
True

# What are idiomatic names?
---
Variable names that conform to convention.
Examples of idiomatic names:
```
cat
employee
number1
fizzBuzz
validateUserInput
tacoShack42
MINUTES_PER_HOUR
parseURL
```
Examples of non-idiomatic names:
```
_cat                   // starts with an underscore
Employee               // starts with an uppercase letter
number_1               // contains an underscore
fizzBUZZ               // second word is all uppercase
validate_User_Input    // contains underscores
taco$hack42            // contains a `$`
MINUTESPERHOUR         // 'constant' - missing underscores between words
paRseURL               // contains an uppercase letter inside of a non-acronym word
```

# What style should we write "regular" variables and object properties in?
---
camelCase

# Why would we want to write certain variable names in uppercase, separated by underscores?
---
To signify that they should be treated as constants. This can improve readability, but the functionality is the same, because JavaScript has only one type of variable.
