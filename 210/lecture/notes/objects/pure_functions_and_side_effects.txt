# What are pure functions?
---
Functions that (1) do not have any side effects and (2) always has the same return values given the same arguments.

Pure functions always return values. A Function that has no side effects and doesn't return a value can't do much of anything.

# What is a side effect?
---
Changes to the world outside the function. (e.g., directly modifying variables defined in outer scopes, or mutating Objects passed to the Function as arguments)
