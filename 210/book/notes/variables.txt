# What scope do variables declared with the `let` or `const` keywords have?
---
Block scope. A block is a related set of JavaScript statements and expressions between a pair of opening and closing curly braces. 

# Should you always declare your variables?
---
Yes. All undeclared variables have global scope, and you don't want that to happen by accident.

# How can you accept user input via the terminal?

You can use the readline-sync library `npm install readline-sync`
Sample usage:
```
let rlSync = require('readline-sync');
let name = rlSync.question("What's your name?\n");
console.log(`Good Morning, ${name}!`);
```
The `question` method returns a String, so if you want to work with the input as numbers, you must coerce them explicitly.
