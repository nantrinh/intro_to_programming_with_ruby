# What does JavaScript treat as falsey?
---
false, the number 0, an empty string, undefined, null, NaN

# What are the return values when using && and ||?
---
The value of the operand evaluated last. Recall that the && and || operators use short-circuit evaluation.

# What are the return values of the following expressions?
3 && 'foo';
'foo' && 3;
0 && 'foo';
'foo' && 0;
---
'foo'; 3; 0; 0

# What are the return values of the following expressions?
3 || 'foo';
'foo' || 3;
0 || 'foo';
'foo' || 0;
'' || 0;
---
3; ; 'foo'; 'foo'; 'foo'; 0;

# Does an if/else statement have a return value?
---
No

# Does the ternary operator have a return value?
---
Yes

# Give an example of JavaScript's ternary operator.
---
condition ? 'this is true' : 'this is false'

# Give an example of JavaScript's `switch` statement.
---
It is equivalent to Ruby's `case` statement.
```
let a = 5;

switch (a) {
case 5:
  console.log('a is 5');
  break;
case 6:
  console.log('a is 6');
  break;
default:
  console.log('a is neither 5, nor 6');
  break;
}

// logs "a is 5" to the console
```

# Is the `break` statement in each `case` essential to a `switch` statement?
---
Yes, otherwise, execution will "fall through" to the next `case` clause.
