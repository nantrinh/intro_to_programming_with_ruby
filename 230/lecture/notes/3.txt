# What is XMLHttpRequest?
---
One of the browser APIs that provide network programming functionality to JavaScript applications. Libraries or utility functions often wrap this web API.
The name comes from its original use, which was to fetch XML documents over HTTP. Today, we use this object to load any data (typically HTML or JSON) and can use other protocols (including file://) as well.

# What is AJAX?
---
AJAX is short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Its main feature is that it allows browsers to issue requests and process responses without a full page refresh.

AJAX requests are just like normal requests: they are sent to the server with all the normal components of an HTTP request, and the server handles them like any other request. The only difference is that instead of the browser refreshing and processing the response, the response is processed by a callback function, which is usually some client-side JavaScript code.

# What is an API?
---
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
They provide functionality for use by another program.

Examples:
- Every programming language has a built-in API that is used to write programs.
- Mobile devices provide APIs to provide access to location or other sensor data, such as the device's GPS location or the orientation of the device.
- Operating systems have APIs that programs can use to open files, access memory, draw text on the screen, etc.

# What are web APIs?
---
APIs that use the HTTP protocol.

# What is an API provider? What is an API consumer?
---
API provider: the system that provides an API for other parties to use.
GitHub is the provider of the GitHub API, and Dropbox is the provider of the Dropbox API.

API consumer: the system that uses the API to accomplish some work.
When you check the weather on your phone, it is running a program that is consuming a weather API to retrieve forecast data.

# What are 3 use cases for APIs?
---
1. share data
2. enable automation. APIs allow users of a service to make use of it in new and useful ways.
3. leverage existing services (e.g., process credit card payments, send emails, fetch information about books, call cellphones, read messages). APIs enable application developers to build their applications on top of a variety of other specialized systems, allowing them to focus on their actual objectives and not worry about all the complexities of every part of the system.

# What is the difference between public and private APIs?
---
Public APIs are intended for consumption outside the organization that provides them. Private APIs are intended only for internal use.

# What do these status codes usually mean? 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX
--
2XX: Request was handled successfully and everything is fine.
3XX: Request was handled sucessfully but the response to the request is located at a different URL. (common response to HTML form POST submission; not scommon response when working with HTTP APIs)
4XX: THe client did something in the request that the server did not like (e.g., required parameter not provided; incorrect URL)
5XX: Server encountered an error. Usually this means that the system you are connecting to is having issues that need to be resolved by those who run it before you can continue, although sometimes it can also be the result of a bad request.

Note that servers do not always return the correct status code, often as a result of a programming oversight. Sometimes it is necessary to look at the entire response for clues as to what is happening when you have received a status code that doesn't make sense.

# What is parsing?
---
The process of converting the data from one format into a representation that is easier to work with for a computer.

# What is the name of the header that describes the format of the response body?
---
Content-Type

# What is the difference between URL and URI?
---
URL, or uniform resource locator, is the location where a resource can be found.
URI, or uniform resource identifier, is a name used to identify a resource. The resources represented by URIs can be anywhere.

URIs are like social security numbers -- you can use them to reference specific individuals, but only knowing their SSN does not tell you where to find them.

URLs are like street addresses. They uniquely identify a location.
URLs also include how to access the resource (http, https)

If you are working with resources on the internet, use URL.

# What are the components of a URL?
---
A protocol, such as http
://, a colon and two slashes
A hostname, usually a domain name such as blogs.com
An optional colon and port, such as :81
The path to the resource, such as /api/v1/pages/1
An optional query string, such as ?query=term

Ports are relatively uncommon in the URLs used when interacting with public APIs.
If you have a full URL and need to know what its path is, remove everything from the beginning to the end of the domain name, and leave the slash.

# When referring to a path in a general sense, how do you denote a placeholder?
---
A value that begins with a colon (e.g., `id` is a placeholder in `/products/:id/`). It is possible for paths to include multiple placeholders (e.g., `/products/:product_id/comments/:id`).

The specific placeholder used within a path isn't important as long as it is unique within the path. It is common for the final identifier to be named :id, while other placeholders have names prefixed with the resource they map to.

# How is HTML represented as a value for the Content-Type header?
---
text/html

# What are data serialization formats?
---
They describe a way for programs to convert data into a form which is more easily or efficiently stored or transferred. The stored or transferred data can then be converted back into the original data at any time by the original program or any other program that can understand its format. 

# What is XML?
---
Extensible markup language.  It is generally stricter than HTML and does not handle missing tags or improper nesting. It is considered an older data serialization format.
Example:
```
<address>
    <street>1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW</street>
    <city>Washington</city>
    <state>DC</state>
    <zipcode>20500</zipcode>
    <country>Unites States</country>
</address>
```

# What is JSON?
---
JavaScript Object Notation. It is perhaps the most popular data serialization format used by web APIs today. It is based on the way object literals are written in JavaScript.
Example:
```
{
  "street": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
  "city": "Washington",
  "state": "DC",
  "zipcode": "20500",
  "country": "United States"
}
```

# What are media types?
---
Media types describe how a response's body is formatted. They are commonly referred to as "content types". JSON is the most popular media type for web APIs.

# What is REST?
---
The term REST is often used to describe a set of conventions for how to build APIs. REST stands for representational state transfer, and it was originally defined by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.

- "representational" refers to how a representation of a resource is being transferred, and not the resource itself.
- "state transfer" refers to how HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that servers don't know anything at all about the clients, and that everything the server needs to process the request (the state) is included in the request itself.

A good way to think about REST is as a way to define everything you might want to do with two values, what and how:
What: Which resource is being acted upon?
How: How are we changing / interacting with the resource?

# What is CRUD?
---
CRUD is an acronym that is used to describe the four actions that can be taken upon resources:

- Create (POST /$RESOURCEs)
- Read (GET /$RESOURCEs/:id)
- Update (PUT /$RESOURCEs/:id)
- Delete (DELETE /$RESOURCEs/:id)

# What is the most powerful thing about REST?
---
Since it is a set of conventions, it is universal and applies just as well to any kind of resource.
By following REST conventions, API designers have fewer decisions to make about how to build an API and API consumers have fewer questions to answer before using one. Fetching an object? It's probably a GET request to /things/:id. Creating a new resource? Use a POST to /things. The resource-centric nature of REST and limited set of CRUD actions limit the complexity for API providers and consumers alike.

# What makes a design RESTful?
---
A RESTful design is one in which any action a user needs to make can be accomplished using CRUD operations on one or many resources. It requires thinking in a resource-oriented way.

Sometimes performing what initially appears to be a single action will translate into multiple requests to a RESTful API. 

# What is a resource?
---
The representation of some grouping of data. A resource can be anything an API user needs to interact with.

# What are elements? What are collections?
---
Elements are the representation of a single resource.
Collections represent a grouping of elements of the same type. It is common for collection and element resources to have a parent-child relationship, where the collection is the "parent" and an element is a "child", although this is not always the case.

Signs a URL is for a collection:
- The path ends in a plural word, such as example.com/products
- The response body contains multiple elements

Signs a URL is for a single element:
- The path ends in a plural word, a slash, and then what could be an identifier (which could be numeric or alphabetic)
- The response body contains a single element

# What does the Accept header specify?
---
What media types the client will accept in response to the request.
`*/*` means the client will accept any media type in a request.
It is better to be more explicit, such as `Accept: application/json`.

# What does the 422 status code mean?
---
Unprocessable entity. The request was invalid in a way that prevented the server from working with it. This is often caused by a validation error.

# What are some common causes for getting a 404 Not Found response?
---
The resource may not exist.
The URL may be incorrect.
Accessing the requested resource may require authentication. In an ideal world, these errors would use a more accurate HTTP status code of 401 or 403, but for security reasons, it is sometimes better to only expose the existence of a resource to those who are authorized to access it.

# What is rate limiting?
---
Each API consumer is allotted a certain number of requests within a specified amount of time. Any requests made beyond these limits are sent an error response and not processed further. The status code of responses to rate limited requests varies by service, but it is often 403 Forbidden. 

# What is the PUT method?
---
A PUT method updates the value of a resource and sends all of its values back to the server. PUT tells the server to "put this resource in this place."

According to the HTTP spec, PUT requests must take a complete representation of the resource being updated. Any parameter left out of a PUT request is assumed to have an empty value (usually null or nil).

Most APIs don't strictly follow this requirement, however, and only update any parameters sent in a PUT request, not changing any other parameters that are already on the resource. This is technically the behavior of the HTTP method PATCH.

# What does 204 No Content mean?
---
The request was processed successfully, and there is nothing in the response body.

# What is OAuth?
---
A system that provides a way for users to authorize access to their account without giving out their credentials.
It involves the usage of an access token, access token secret, application key, and application secret. You need all four values to make requests.

# How does using AJAX differ from the usual browser request-response cycle?
---
With the usual cycle, 
1. User clicks link on a web page.
2. Browser sends HTTP request to server.
3. Server returns entire HTML page.
4. Browser parses and displays new page in viewport.

With AJAX,
1. User action triggers event listener.
2. JavaScript sends HTTP request to server using XMLHttpRequest.
3. Server returns chunk of HTML code.
4. JavaScript code inserts new HTML into page.

# What are single page applications?
---
Applications that fetch data in a serialized format and create the DOM entirely from JavaScript running in a client's browser.
They often run entirely within a single HTML page. 
Instead of fetching bits of HTML generated by a server, this model does all interactions by passing data to and from the server, often encoded as JSON.

# Write some example code to send a XMLHttpRequest, and to examine the response.
---
```
var request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Instantiate new XMLHttpRequest object
request.open('GET', '/path');       // Set HTTP method and URL on request
request.send();                     // Send request

// request completes

request.responseText;                       // body of response
request.status;                             // status code of response
request.statusText;                         // status text from response

request.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');  // response header

request.readyState;                         // more on this later...
```

# Is the send method of an XMLHttpRequest synchronous or asynchronous?
---
Asynchronous. The XMLHttpRequest object uses event listeners to send notifications when the request completes and provides access to the response returned by the remote system.

We can wait for the response to load by listening for the load event:
```
request.addEventListener('load', function(event) {
  var request = event.target;                 // the XMLHttpRequest object

  request.responseText;                       // body of response
  request.status;                             // status code
  request.statusText;                         // status text from response

  request.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');  // response header

  request.readyState;                         // more on this later...
});
```

# What are the XMLHttpRequest methods to perform the following actions?
- open a connection to `url` using `method`
- send the request, optionally sending along `data`
- set HTTP `header` to `value`
- cancel an active request
- return the response's value for `header`
---
open(method, url)
send(data)
setRequestHeader(header, value)
abort()
getResponseHeader(header)

# What are the XMLHttpRequest properties to return the following information?
- maximum time a request can take to complete (in milliseconds)
- what state the request is in
- raw text of the response's body
- parsed content of response (note: not meaningful in all situations)
---
timeout, read-write, default 0
readyState, read
responseText, read, default null
response, read, default null

# What are the main events that may fire during an XMLHttpRequest cycle?
---
`loadstart`, when the request is sent to the server

Either
`load`, if a complete response is loaded
`abort`, if the request was interrupted before it could complete
`error`, if an error occurred
`timeout`, if a response was not received before the timeout period ended

Lastly,
`loadend`, when the response is loaded and all other events have fired

Also,
`readystatechange`, when the value of `readyState` changes
`progress`, when response data is received (in some situations)

# Does JSON provide native support for complex data types like dates and times?
---
No. You must represent such values in a format that both the client and server understand; strings, numbers, and objects work well for this in most cases.

# Is it good practice to include the `charset` in the `Content-Type` header when making a request?
---
Yes. Providing the charset ensures that the server interprets the data with the correct encoding. You can use charset=utf-8 in most cases, meaning that the data uses the UTF-8 character encoding.
`Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`

# What is the origin of a URL?
---
The scheme, hostname, and port.

# What is the name of hte policy that prevents XMLHttpRequest from making cross-domain requests?
---
Same-origin policy. This limits communication to the same domain, the same port, and the same protocol. Any attempt to communicate outside these limits result in a security error.

# What is a cross-origin request?
---
When a page tries to access a resource from a different origin.

# What is a security vulnerability related to cross-domain requests?
---
When a user is lured into clicking a link that sends a request with the user's login credentials to a malicious application.

# What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?
---
A W3C specification that defines how the browser and server must communicate when accessing resources across origins.

It fulfills the need for legitimate cross-origin requests. It gives us a standard way to access resources from different origins without the security problems associated with cross-origin requests.

The idea behind CORS is to let the two systems know enough about each other to determine whether the response should succeed or fail. Applications use custom HTTP request and response headers to implement this mechanism.

# What is throttling?
---
Delay sending an XHR to the server for a short period, and not send it at all if we no longer need it.

# It is the responsibility of the application code to determine whether a `request` was successful from its perspective by inspecting the response with which event handler?
---
`load`

# Will the code below result in an error? If so, why? Assume the URL is valid and that the server responds appropriately.
```
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'http://foo.bar/api/data');
request.responseType = 'json';
request.addEventListener('load', function(event) {
  var data = JSON.parse(request.response);

  // do something with data
});

request.send();
```
---
JSON.parse is not necessary here and results in an error. The reason is that the value passed to JSON.parse will be an object instead of a string. The value will be an object because we have set the responseType to JSON. The browser will handle the parsing for us.
