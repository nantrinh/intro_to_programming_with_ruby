This prints
`BOB`
`BOB`
On line 1, the local variable `name` is initialized and assigned the String object with value `'Bob'`. 
On line 2, the local variable `save_name` is initialized and assigned the object pointed to by the `name` variable, which is `'Bob'`.
On line 3, the `String#upcase!` method is called on the `name` variable. This method modifies the value pointed to by `name` to the upcased version of the value, which is `BOB`. Since this modifies the caller, both `name` and `save_name` continue to point to the same object, but the object's value has changed after the `#upcase!` method was called. Hence on line 4, `'BOB'` is printed out twice.
