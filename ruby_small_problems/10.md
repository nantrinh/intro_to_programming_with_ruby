In line 4, each element of array1 is added to array2. After this line is evaluated,
array2 and array1's elements are pointers to the same objects.
On line 4, each element of array1 is mutated if the value starts with either `'C'`
or `'S'`. This change is reflected in array2 as well. Though array1 and array2 have different object ids, the object ids of its elements in the same indexes are the same. (e.g., element 1 of array1 and element 1 of array2 have the same object id). They both point to the same object.
