new string

On line 7, a reference to the String object with value `'hello world'` is passed in. The method now has access to the original object.
The `#split` method is called on the String object, which returns an array of words split on the spaces in the string. At this point it is no longer possible to get the original object back again.

The `#each` method is then called on the array of words. Each element of the array is assigned in turn to the `word` variable. The `#reverse!` method is called on each word, which mutates the word in the array, reversing the order of characters of each word. After all words are iterated through, the original array (with each element now modified by `#reverse!` is returned, and the `#join` method is called on this array. This joins the elements together with a space and returns a new string.
