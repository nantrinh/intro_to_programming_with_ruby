  - all strings will be trimmed
  - month property valid values
    - empty string
    - an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive
  - year property valid values
    - empty string
    - any non-negative integer
  - title and description
    - must have at least one non-whitespace character 
    - capitalization not enforced
- initialization of todoList
  - if the number of items in the todoSet is greater than or equal to n, then the first n items are added to the todoList
  - if the number of items in the todoSet is less than n, then todoList will loop over the entire list repeatedly until it has created n items
  - all todoData objects must be valid inputs for any todo objects to be added to the todoList. Otherwise 'Invalid input' is logged to the console and `false` is returned
