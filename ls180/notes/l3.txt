# What is a relation?
Usually another way to say "table." Tables (sets of columns and rows of data), sequences, and views. If you can use something in the FROM clause in a SELECT statement, it is probably a relation.

# What is a relationship?
An association between data stored in relations. A connection between entities (rows of data), usually resulting from what those entities represent and how they are related to one another. For example, a customers table has a relationship with a table called orders.

# What is a functional definition of relational data?
Working with more than one table at a time.

# What are the three levels of schema/abstraction?
(less detail) Conceptual, Logical, Physical (more detail)
Conceptual: higher level concepts. Phone has contacts. Contacts have phone numbers and names.
Logical: not specific to an actual database. Not common to work with this leel.
Physical: Data types, entities, attributes. Implementation of conceptual schema in a specific database.

# Define conceptual schema.
High-level design focused on identifying entities and their relationships. (Entity-relationship model)

# Define physical schema.
Low-level database-specific design focused on implementation.

# When there is a one-to-many relationship, you know that on the "one" side you have a ____ key and on the "many" side, you have a ______ key.
primary; foreign

# Whenever you have a _____-to-_____ relationship, there is always going to be an extra table that represents that relationship. These extra tables are also called ______ tables.
many; many; join 

# True or False: The number of entities in a high-level conceptual schema always matches the number of tables you have in a low-level physical schema.
False

# What is cardinality?
The number of objects on each side of the relationship (1:1, 1:M, M:M)

# What is modality?
Determines if the relationship is required (1) or optional (0). Lower bound on how many instances there can be in a relationship.

# True or False: A foreign key constraint prevents NULL values from being stored in a column.
False. Foreign key columns allow NULL values.
