You can use if, elsif, elsif, else (default output), end. As is, you get nil as the returned output for every input unless that input is "Einstein", because if there isn't an explicit `return` statement, only the result of the last evaluated statement gets returned. 

Another way to fix it is to put a `return` in front of each possible returned quote.
